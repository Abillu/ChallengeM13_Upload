#  Design and building  deep neural network model 

This is a design  and building of a binary clsassification model using deep neural network—that is, a neural network with multiple neuron layers between the model’s input and output layers, to help a venture fund predict which startups will become financially successful. The design involved compiling a neural network model and testing  different parameters to determine the values that generate the most accurate model


## Methodology and Approach

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Compile, train, and evaluate a neural network model.

Optimize a neural network model.


## Libraries and Technologies Used

- Pandas library -  a Python library for data analysis. 

- TensorFlow and Keras libraries  - build deep learning model.

- sklearn library to train model and standardize data 




## Summary of findings 
The original model built acheived  73.12%  accurracy level. Alternative optmizing models  were built by increasing the number of epochs and the number of hidden layers. However these did not enhance the model's accuracy.
